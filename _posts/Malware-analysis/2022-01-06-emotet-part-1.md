# Introduction

Emotet is a Trojan that spreads through spam emails. The infection may arrive either via malicious script, macro-enabled
document files, or malicious link. [1](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/emotet-101-how-the-ransomware-works----and-why-it-s-so-darn-effective) 

#### Download the sample: [Here](https://app.any.run/tasks/f907a5b5-689a-472d-a2f7-1a2c4899fc96/)

MD5: `CA06ACD3E1CAB1691A7670A5F23BAEF4`

# Virustotal [VT](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/CA06ACD3E1CAB1691A7670A5F23BAEF4)

we can see that the malware is detected by 57 out of 68 as a trojan.

1- Different names of the sample

Shows compilation Timestamp which can be changed. and Shows number of sections

# DiE

**open DiE to get more info about the sample**

As we see that info about **file type**, **Entry point**, and **sections**. It will help us in our analysis

## Entropy:

**press over “Entropy” as in the previous figure(4)**

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/5.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(5): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>

Shows that it has **high** entropy in **.text** section which is an indicator to be packed

# PEstudio analysis

## Indicators section:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/6.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(6): <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

*Level 1 is most malicious and bigger numbers “3” are less malicious. Shows different malicious indicators that help us in the analysis.

## Sections section:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/7.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(7): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>

**The previous figure shows:**

  1- .text section is packed 

  2- .text section contains the entry point for the executable. This means that, in addition to holding the compressed data, .text section also contains the stub code responsible for unpacking. [2](https://malware.news/t/the-basics-of-packed-malware-manually-unpacking-upx-executables/35961)

  *The section which is responsible for unpacking can vary as in UPX packing 

  3- .text section is executable 

  4- .data section is writable 

## Strings section:

**press over `blacklist` to list them**

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/8.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(8): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


Strings are good indicators to know what this malware is trying to do on the system

# IDA analysis

To analyze the assemble code to know how to unpack and where to start the debugging

Open it in IDA: It shows that is low number of functions which another indicator that is packed

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/9.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(9): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>

Press over “start” which located in the function as in the previous figure to get started

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/10.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(10): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


Because Emotet malware uses a customized packer. we can try to unpack it through **dynamic analysis**. Through **dynamic analysis** the malware does the unpacking process. **The process will need to allocate memory for the next stage**.

So it’s a good assumption that we will see a **call to VirtualAlloc**. We need to search which function has VirtualAlloc call. [3](https://distributedcompute.com/2020/02/20/unpacking-emotet/)

If you searched you will find that **call `sub_417D50`** is the unpacking routine

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/11.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(11): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


This our unpacking function: **`sub_417D50`**

<p align="center">

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(12): <u></u> </font></center> 


## Abnormal prologue

First we need to clear **what normal epilogue and prologue are?**
 The procedure prologue and epilogue are standard initialization sequences that compilers generate for almost all of their functions.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/13.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(13): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


What is **NOT normal** here is epilogue in the last figure:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/14.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(14): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


you don't `push` anything before `ret` this called abnormal.

normal epilogue is to `pop EBP` before `ret`. Here it will return `ecx` because it executes the last instruction- top of the stack.

And the real return is from this function `loc_417D9A` because this is 2nd top of the stack.

We need to know what is happening in this function?

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/15.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(15): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


**In the last figure we see the coming:**

  `VirtualAlloc` is moved to `ECX`, then
  `ECX` is moved to `dword_41C218`, then
  `dword_41C218` is moved to `ECX`
  then `push ECX` and then `ret`
  And the real return is from this function `loc_417D9A`

So we need to know the address of this function to set a Breakpoint in x64dbg by pressing `space`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/16.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(16): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


We know that code is packed. **We search for abnormal jumps:**

  jump or call Instructions to registers

  Jump to strange memory addresses (long jump)

Why searching for abnormal jumps? the address to the location of where data is being unpacked to is stored in a register (such as ecx), and that memory address is often in an entirely different section.

**I will write an article about “indicators of packed file”. InshAllah**

If we return to **start function** and search you will find it.

Here we see our abnormal `jmp ecx`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/17.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(17): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>


Press `space` to get its address: `00417F1F`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/emotet-1/18.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(18): <u></u> </font></center> 
<br>

**How to Unpack in the next part. InshAllah**
