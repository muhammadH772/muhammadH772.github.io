# Introduction
Redline Stealer has been delivered through various channels. Redline Stealer is mostly distributed through Phishing Emails or malicious software disguised as installation files such as Telegram, Discord, and cracked software. However, recently, Phishing Link that downloads Chrome Extension containing Redline Stealer by abusing YouTube Video Description and Google Ads is utilized, or Python Script that runs Redline Stealer through FTP is being distributed.

I used tried to analysis three samples, but this is more harder `d81d3c919ed3b1aaa2dc8d5fbe9cf382` which the classes and arguments are obfuscated. But eventually the three samples are the same but different keys. Download the article sample from [vx-underground](https://samples.vx-underground.org/samples/Families/RedLine/Samples/0adb0e2ac8aa969fb088ee95c4a91536.7z) or [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/b06a04969f5856d665a1e837f7aed8b1adfca9e44d06e7d5100b8c3adac4df79/).

# Unpacking 

Our sample comes packed by `IntelliLock v.1.5.x` packer. We will use [upacme](https://www.unpac.me/results/82b0306c-7be2-4e83-828a-8b9a93361e2c) to unpack the sample. Then we continue analysis with the sample `e90f6d0a7b7d0f23d0b105003fce91959c2083c23394b5cf43101c84ae8be4d2`.

# Configuration Extraction

RedLine encodes its C2 server and the unaique ID using hard-coded key and uses the key to decrypt the C2 server and the ID. We enter `EntryPoint` class to see encoded Configuration.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(2): Endcoded Configuration<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

In this sample, the decrption function is `Decrypt()`. It will decrypt the C2 server and the unique ID using the key `Pythonic`. **The decoding operation is FromBase64 then XOR then FromBase64** using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). 
The C2 server address is `46.8.19.196:53773` and the ID is `ytmaloy8`.

<br>

# C2 server Communication

After decoding, the malware will send request using `RequestConnection()` to `net.tcp://" + C2 address + "/"`. If there is a conncetion, the malware will try to get the settings `ScanningArgs` which is a structure that stores configuration data and shows what the malware capabilities. The arguments have flags which will decide which information will be collected, such as Hardware info, Browser credentials, FTP credentials, etc.

<br>

# Collecting Information

The RedLine malware collects many information about the infected host and stores it into `ScanResult` which include the environment settings about the infected host such as Hardware info, ID, etc and `ScanDetails` whcih stores the credential details information. Then we enter `ResultFactory` class to explore its actions and see what info will be stolen as follows

  <img src="/assets/images/MA/redline/5.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(5): the collected info from the infected host<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

Then we start explaining these actions and how the RedLine malware gets files and info in details. There are actions which are easy to figure out such as generate unique MD5 hash, get executed file path, get language, timeZone, resolution info, OSVersion, etc. And installed softwares by checking `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`. And running processes info such as `processID`, `Name`, `commandLine`.

## Installed Browsers

RedLine malware collectes the information about installed browsers such as `NameOfBrowser`, `Version`, and `PathOfFile` from the `BrowserVersion` class.

  <img src="/assets/images/MA/redline/6.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(6): the collected info of the installed browsers<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

Then it search for Chrome based browsers such as `Chromium`, `Chrome`, `Opera`. And collects `BrowserName`, `BrowserProfile`, `Logins`, `Autofills`, and `Cookies` in  `ScannedBrowser()`class.

Then Gecko based browsers such as `Firefox`, `Waterfox`. And collects `BrowserName`, `BrowserProfile`, `Logins`, `Autofills`, and `Cookies` in  `ScannedBrowser()`class.

## Message Clients
The malware gets info about message clients such as Telegram and uses `DesktopMessangerRule()` to get the path of `tdata` folder which is used to store data of the Telegram application.

<br>

## FTP credentials

The malware tries to collect FTP (Transfer Protocol client) credentials through searching in paths such as `{0}\\FileZilla\\recentservers.xml`, `{0}\\FileZilla\\sitemanager.xml`. Then uses  `ScanCredentials()` class to extract the account credentials such as `Host`, `Port`, `User`, `Password` from the XML file.

<br>

## Crypto wallets
A crypto wallet is a program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. The malware tries to search for wallet extentions which is in `BrowserExtensionsRule()` such as `YoroiWallet`, `Coinbase`, `BinanceChain`, `BraveWallet`, `iWallet`, and `AtomicWallet`.

<br>

## VPN credentials
The malware tries to collect `NordVPN`, `OpenVPN`, and `ProtonVPN` credentials. 
For OpenVPN, `OpenVPNRule()` class search for XML file which contains the credentials. And so for ProtonVPN uses `ProtonVPNRule()`class to search for protonVPN credentials

## Checks if Blocked list

Here the malware gets the `location`, `IP`, and `country` and checks if it is located in the black list. If yes, malware does nothing and exit.

<br>

## Remote execution

The malware can use the command line `CommandLineUpdate()` and download some extra payloads or malicious files after collecting the information about the infected host  using `DownloadUpdate()` and executes it using `DownloadAndExecuteUpdate()` and start the process which used as a dropper.
